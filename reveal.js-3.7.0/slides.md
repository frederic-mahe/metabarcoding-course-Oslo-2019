Let's start with redirections and then
[swarm](https://github.com/torognes/swarm).

``` bash
for i in {1..3} ; do
    echo "test"
done
```
`$$ J(\theta_0,\theta_1) = \sum_{i=0} $$`

Note: don't forget to say that.


<!--- describe the fastq format -->
Then we will discuss fastq format. How exciting!

``` bash
while true ; do
    echo "success"
done
```

Note: mention that fastq is not a defined standard. Sad!


<!--- explain code-blocks -->
accents are supported: Frédéric and Torbjørn, 中华人民共和国.
```python
def do_something():
    action = "did something"
    print(action)
    return 0
```

Note: This will only display in the notes window.
